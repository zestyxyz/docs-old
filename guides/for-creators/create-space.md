## 1. Creating a Space

### **Connect your wallet**

Go to [https://www.zesty.market/](https://www.zesty.market) and click on **Launch App**.

Before doing anything, you will need to switch to the Polygon Network in your wallet. If you are using MetaMask, the network selection menu will look like this:

If Polygon (or Matic) is not in your Network list, you will either need to [manually add the RPC](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/network-details/network/) or connect to a Polygon based dApp like [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap) which will automate the process for you.

You'll be sent to the **Create A Space NFT** page. This is where you can fill in your Space details, including name, image and link. Each Space is an NFT and the details are the metadata attached to the NFT.

  * Some ideas: Space location (eg: top right of the page), average visitors, your WebXR experience details, livestreaming channel details, anything.
* **Format**

When the transaction is completed, you'll receive a notification from MetaMask. You may check on your Space by going to the Space page. If the Space is listed, you're done creating your Space NFT!

## **Deposit**

**Depositing your Space NFT to Zesty's smart contract is required in order to create an auction.**

In the Space page, you'll find **Deposit NFT** button, click on it.

A deposit NFT pop-up will appear. There are 2 actions you are required to do here, **Approve** and **Deposit**. You'll need to do each of the action one-by-one. Both of the buttons will result in MetaMask pop-ups requiring you to confirm your actions.
