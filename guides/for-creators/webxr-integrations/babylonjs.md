## Before You Integrate

You will first need to create a Space NFT in order to get started checkout "For Creators" for more instructions.

### Importing the SDK

**NPM Project** - install it like so:

```
npm install '@zestymarket/babylonjs-sdk'
```

Once installed, import the ZestyBanner component:

```
import * as Zesty from '@zestymarket/babylonjs-sdk';
```

**Warning**: Make sure you are using the same babylon.js version as the Zesty package. You can check here: https://github.com/zestymarket/sdk/blob/main/babylonjs/package.json

If you are using an unsupported version, you can import a specific version of three.js from services like CDN: [https://cdn.skypack.dev/babylonjs@version](https://cdn.skypack.dev/babylonjs@4.2.1)

**HTML Tag** - Paste this into the `<head>`:

Zesty can be imported through a single HTML page, no need to install it as a Node Package.

```
<script src="https://ipfs.io/ipns/lib.zesty.market/zesty-babylonjs-sdk.js"></script>
```

### Bringing the Zesty Banner into your scene

Make sure you have a reference to your scene and WebXRHelper (if applicable), then copy and paste:

```
const zestyBanner = new ZestyBanner("0", "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "tall", "standard", 3, scene, xrHelper);
```

Replace `0` with your Space ID and  `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with your wallet address

Substitute variable names as needed. The last parameter for the WebXRHelper is optional.

You can also pass the argument `true` if you would like to opt into Zesty Analytics. Anyone will be able to view this on your Space's page, where it will display a history of visits to your space and clicks on your banner.

Adding a banner to the previous example would look like this:

```
const zestyBanner = new ZestyBanner("0", "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "tall", "standard", 3, scene, xrHelper, true);
```
