To buy an advertising timeslot you will first need to obtain USDC token, which is the token currently used by Zesty Market.

The overview of the steps to buying USDC:

1. Buy ETH from your preferred exchange
2. Send the ETH to your MetaMask wallet
3. Transfer the ETH from the Ethereum mainnet to Polygon network via Matic Bridge
4. Swap ETH for USDC on Sushi Swap

### Getting ETH

First you'll need to load up your wallet with ETH. You can do so by buying ETH on exchanges such as [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) or [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en). You can then transfer the ETH to your Metamask wallet. To find your wallet address, refer below image:

### Send ETH from Mainnet to Polygon

Once you have the ETH in your MetaMask wallet, you'll need to send the ETH from Ethereum mainnet to Polygon Network via [Matic Bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/).

{% hint style="info" %}
The transaction could take a while, depending on how much gwei (gas fee) you allocated for your transaction. The higher you allocated, the faster the transaction will be.

Please while transactions get confirmed. The project will look into fast and reliable chains in the near future.
{% endhint %}

### Swapping ETH for USDC

When you have your ETH in Polygon network, you may now go to [https://app.sushi.com/swap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) to swap ETH for USDC. Make sure you are in Polygon network (go to your MetaMask wallet, click on the network dropdown on top of the wallet, click and choose Polygon network that you have set up earlier)

Next, you'll want to choose Swap from as **WETH** and swap to as **USDC**.

Once you've chosen the right tokens (WETH and USDC), choose the amount of ETH you want to swap or the amount of UDSC you want to swap to. Whichever you choose, the platform will auto-calculate how much you'll swap for.

Click on **Confirm Swap**.

You'll also be given an option to add USDC token to your MetaMask, click **Confirm**. This will allow you to see how much USDC you have in your wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}

Once the transaction is done, you'll see a small pop-up on your screen. You can also check your USDC balance on your MetaMask wallet.&#x20;
